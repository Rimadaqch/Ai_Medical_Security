# AI for Medical Data Security

![Project Banner](https://example.com/your-image.jpg)

## Overview

This project aims to enhance the security of sensitive medical data using AI techniques. The primary focus is on detecting anomalies in access patterns and improving data security with a Random Forest model.

## Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual access patterns in medical data.
- **Data Encryption**: Uses AI algorithms to secure sensitive information.
- **Secure Data Transfer**: Implements protocols to ensure safe data transfer.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Insurance Dataset](https://example.com/insurance-dataset), which contains information about patient demographics, BMI, and insurance charges.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Model Training**: Train a Random Forest model for anomaly detection.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using classification metrics.
